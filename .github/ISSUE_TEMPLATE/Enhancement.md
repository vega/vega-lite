## Enhancement Description

Describe the feature's goal, motivating use cases, and its expected behavior.

If you are proposing a new syntax, please provide at least one example spec, wrapped by triple backticks like this:

```json
{
  "mark": "point",
  "encoding": {"x": {"field": "a"}}
}
```

You are encouraged to prototype multiple alternative syntaxes for your proposed feature. Doing so often leads to a better design.
