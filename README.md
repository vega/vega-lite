# Vega-Lite 2 ALPHA

**Announcement:** The `master` branch now hosts ongoing Vega-Lite 2.0 *pre-release* development.
We have migrated Vega-Lite to use the new Vega 3 Beta and D3 v4.
Our next alpha releases will introduce a few syntax revisions as well as new composition and interaction features from [our research publication](http://idl.cs.washington.edu/papers/vega-lite).

For a more stable version, please use Vega-Lite v1. We have created branch [`1.x`](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite/tree/1.x) as our v1 maintenance branch.

Vega-Lite provides a higher-level grammar for visual analysis, akin to ggplot or Tableau, that generates complete [Vega](https://vega.github.io/) specifications.
