If a field is specified, the channel definition **must** describe the encoded data's type based on their [level of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement). The supported data types are: [`"quantitative"`](#quantitative), [`"temporal"`](#temporal), [`"ordinal"`](#ordinal), [`"nominal"`](#nominal), and [`"geojson"`](#geojson).

{% include table.html props="type" source="TypedFieldDef" %}

{:#quantitative}

## Quantitative

Quantitative data expresses some kind of quantity. Typically this is numerical data. For example `7.3`, `42.0`, `12.1`.

Quantitative data can represent either the ratio or interval [level of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement). By default, Vega-Lite includes zero values in the x, y, and size scales for quantitative fields, which is more appropriate for ratio data. However, you can manually set the [scale's `zero` property](scale.html#continuous) to `false` if you have interval data.

{:#temporal}

## Temporal

Temporal data supports date-times and times such as `"2015-03-07 12:32:17"`, `"17:01"`, `"2015-03-16"`, `"2015"`, `1552199579097` (timestamp).

Note that when a `"temporal"` type is used for a field, Vega-Lite will treat it as a continuous field and thus will use a [`time` scale](scale.html#time) to map its data to visual values. For example, the following bar chart shows the mean precipitation for different months.

<span class="vl-example" data-name="bar_month_temporal"></span>

{:#ordinal}

## Ordinal

Ordinal data represents ranked order (1st, 2nd, ...) by which the data can be sorted. However, as opposed to quantitative data, there is no notion of _relative degree of difference_ between them. For illustration, a "size" variable might have the following values `small`, `medium`, `large`, `extra-large`. We know that medium is larger than small and same for extra-large larger than large. However, we cannot compare the magnitude of relative difference, for example, between (1) `small` and `medium` and (2) `medium` and `large`. Similarly, we cannot say that `large` is two times as large as `small`.

To use an ordinal field with a sort order other than the natural order, you may want to use the [`sort`](sort.html#sort-array) property to specify a customized order:

<div class="vl-example" data-name="bar_custom_sort_full"></div>

**Note:** If an encoding includes a custom sort order, Vega-Lite uses the ordinal type by default, so you actually can omit `"type": "ordinal"` from the specification above.

{:#cast-timeunit}

### Casting a Temporal Field as an Ordinal Field

To treat a date-time field with `timeUnit` as a discrete field, you can cast it to be an `"ordinal"` field. This type casting can be useful for time units with low cardinality such as `"month"`.

<span class="vl-example" data-name="bar_month"></span>

{:#cast-bin}

### Casting a Binned Field as an Ordinal Field

Setting a binned field's `type` to `"ordinal"` produces a histogram with an ordinal scale.

<div class="vl-example" data-name="histogram_ordinal"></div>

{:#nominal}

## Nominal

Nominal data, also known as categorical data, differentiates between values based only on their names or categories. For example, gender, nationality, music genre, and name are nominal data. Numbers may be used to represent the variables but the number do not determine magnitude or ordering. For example, if a nominal variable contains three values 1, 2, and 3. We cannot claim that 1 is less than 2 nor 3.

{:#geojson}

## GeoJSON

GeoJSON data represents geographic shapes specified as [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/).
