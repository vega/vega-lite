**Vega-Lite** is a high-level grammar for interactive graphics. It provides a concise JSON syntax for supporting rapid generation of interactive multi-view visualizations to support analysis. Vega-Lite can serve as a declarative format for describing and creating data visualizations. To use Vega-Lite, our compiler compiles a Vega-Lite specification into a lower-level, more detailed [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega) specifications and rendered using Vega's compiler.

This documentation describes the [JSON specification language](#spec) and how to [use Vega-Lite visualizations]({{site.baseurl}}/usage/embed.html) in a web application.
