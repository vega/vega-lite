This is an incomplete list of integrations, applications, and extensions of the Vega-Lite language and compiler. If you want to add a tool or library, [edit this file and send us a pull request](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite/blob/master/site/usage/applications.md).

## Bindings for programming languages

* [Altair](https://github.com/ellisonbg/altair) exposes a Python API for building statistical visualizations that follows Vega-Lite syntax.
* [Vega for Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/vega/ipyvega) supports Vega and Vega-Lite charts.
* [Vega-Lite for Julia](https://github.com/fredo-dedup/VegaLite.jl)
* [Vega-Lite "bindings" for R](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/vegalite), create Vega-Lite visualizations in R.
* [vegaliteR](https://github.com/timelyportfolio/vegaliteR), vega-lite htmlwidget for R.
* [Vegas](https://github.com/aishfenton/Vegas) brings visualizations to Scala and Spark using Vega-Lite. 
* [Vizard](https://github.com/yieldbot/vizard) provides a tiny REPL client to visualize Clojure data in the browser.

## Tools

* [Polestar](https://github.com/vega/polestar), lightweight Tableau-style interface for visual analysis
* [Voyager](https://github.com/vega/voyager), visualization browser for open-ended data exploration
* [Lyra](https://github.com/vega/lyra), an interactive, graphical Visualization Design Environment (VDE)
* [nteract](https://github.com/nteract/nteract), interactive notebook application with Vega and Vega-Lite renderer
* [Vega-VSCode](https://github.com/vega/vega-vscode), Vega Language Plug-in for Visual Studio Code
* [mondrian-rest-ui](https://github.com/jazzido/mondrian-rest-ui), an experimental UI for [`mondrian-rest`](https://github.com/jazzido/mondrian-rest) inspired by [Polestar](https://github.com/vega/polestar) and [CubesViewer](https://github.com/jjmontesl/cubesviewer).
* [data.world](https://data.world), upload `.vg.json` and `.vl.json` files along side your raw data, or [embed vega](https://docs.data.world/tutorials/markdown/#vega-and-vega-lite) directly into comments and summary markdown.
* [vega-desktop](https://github.com/kristw/vega-desktop), a desktop app that let you open `.vg.json` and `.vl.json` to see visualizations just like you open image files with an image viewer. Can also be used for [creating visualizations with vega/vega-lite locally](https://medium.com/@kristw/create-visualizations-with-vega-on-your-machine-using-your-preferred-editor-529e1be875c0).
* [Visdown](http://visdown.com), a web app to create Vega-Lite visualisations in Markdown. Specs are written in [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) (not JSON) within `code` blocks.
