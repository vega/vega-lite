If you would rather compile your Vega-Lite specifications into Vega, you can use Vega-Lite's included [JavaScript compiler](#javascript) or one of several bundled [command line utilities](#cli).

First install Vega-Lite using npm (`npm install vega-lite`) or by [downloading the latest release](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite/releases/latest). (For the latter, you will also have to download [Vega](https://github.com/vega/vega/releases/latest) and [D3](https://d3js.org).)

{:#javascript}

## Using JavaScript

If you want access to the compiled Vega spec from a JavaScript program, you can compile your Vega-Lite spec using the `vegaLite.compile` function.

```js
var vgSpec = vegaLite.compile(vlSpec, options).spec;
```

If provided, the `options` argument should be an object with one or more of the following properties:

- [`config`](#config) sets a default config
- [`logger`](#logging) sets a logger
- [`fieldTitle`](#field-title) sets a field title formatter

{:#config}

### Customized Configuration

You can specify a [config]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/config.html) object as a property of the `compile` function's `options` argument. Note that configuration properties provided via the `config` property in the Vega-Lite specification, will override the configurations passed in through the `compile` function.

{:#logging}

### Customized Logging

By default, warnings and other messages are printed to the JavaScript console (via `console.log/warn` methods). To redirect the log messages, you can pass a customize logger to the compile function.

```js
var vgSpec = vegaLite.compile(vlSpec, {logger: logger}).spec;
```

A custom logger should implement the following interface:

```typescript
interface LoggerInterface {
  level: (_: number) => number | LoggerInterface;
  warn(...args: any[]): LoggerInterface;
  info(...args: any[]): LoggerInterface;
  debug(...args: any[]): LoggerInterface;
}
```

{:#field-title}

### Customized Field Title Formatter

To customize how Vega-Lite generates axis or legend titles for a [field definition](encoding.html#field-def), you can provide a `fieldTitle` function as a property of the `compile` function's `options` argument.

```js
const vgSpec = vegaLite.compile(vlSpec, {
  fieldTitle: function (fieldDef, config) {
    const fn = fieldDef.aggregate || fieldDef.timeUnit || (fieldDef.bin && 'bin');
    if (fn) {
      return `${fn.toUpperCase()}(${fieldDef.field})`;
    } else {
      return fieldDef.field;
    }
  },
}).spec;
```

{:#cli}

## From the Command Line

If you want to compile your Vega-Lite specs from the command line, we provide a set of scripts which make it easy to go from Vega-Lite to Vega, SVG, PNG, or PDF. These scripts are `vl2vg`, `vl2png`, `vl2svg`, and `vl2pdf` respectively.

Each script simply accepts your Vega-Lite specification as its first argument.

`vl2svg spec.vl.json`

You can also pass in data via stdin.

`cat spec.vl.json | vl2svg`

The `vg2vg` command supports an optional argument `p` that formats the generated Vega spec.

`vl2vg spec.vl.json -p`

The easiest way to run these commands is to use [`npx`](https://github.com/npm/npx). `npx` will automatically run the commands from the local `node_modules/.bin`, or from a central cache, installing any packages needed in order for the commands to run. It Is not necessary to have Vega or Vega-Lite installed ahead of time for `npx` to work.

`npx vl2vg spec.vl.json`

If you want to use the scripts in your project, you can prefix the calls with `node_modules/.bin/`. Alternatively, you can install vega and vega-lite globally (although we do not recommend it).

If you get an error `Error: CanvasRenderer is missing a valid canvas or context`, please install the [`canvas`](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) package (or install vega-cli).

### Using npx

To use [npx](https://github.com/npm/npx), a tool to execute npm binaries, provide the required packages and choose the binary you want to run. For example, to run `vl2png`, run `npx -p vega -p vega-lite vl2png --help`.
